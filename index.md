### About Me

I am a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research Asia. My research spans near-storage accelerators, vector databases, hardware disaggregation, and large-scale AI infrastructure.

I'm especially interested in **AI chip and infrastructure design**, leveraging Artificial Specialized Intelligence to co-optimize workloads, system software, and hardware from a top-down perspective.
